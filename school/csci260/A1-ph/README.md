| **Assignment Description** | Using similar extraction methods to the class example of calculating discharge, but instead we find pH statistics from the same source in a CSV file |

| Note #1  | This program design could be developed into an entire O.O.P. project with a StatsClass object containing functions for calculating any desired descriptive statistics, which can then be used in conjunction with an ExtractorClass for CSV file structures, as well as other commonly evaluated data structures for a mostly universal template read/write file program. |

| 02/03/26 | Began reworking Mr. Castleton's orginal code into a function that calculates descriptive statistics for pH level float values.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 02/03/26 | Added some Python rich features for colored text as well as a file-write feature for logging of calculated values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 02/04/26 | Got hyperfixated and reworked the entire project with well defined variables and more python rich features; table, and colored output. Also reformatted the file-write into a semi-workable structure for later extraction of calculated values if desired. File-write now also includes description and timestamp for data access. |
